# publish/subscribe sample code #

**To Build**
Just run your favorite make.

``` shell
make all
```

I've include some rudimentary doxygen comments:

``` shell
make docs
```

**To Run**
./pubsub

**Notes**
This example code is not very interactive.  It first runs a series of semi-unit tests, then pretends to setup a real world example.
